## M1 Advanced Keras Functionalities
### Summary
- Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK.
    
- Keras is widely used in industry and academia for various applications, from image and speech recognition to recommendation systems and natural language processing.
    
- Keras Functional API offers advantages like flexibility, clarity, and reusability.
    
- You can use Keras Functional API to develop models in diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving.
    
- Keras Functional API enables you to define layers and connect them in a graph of layers.
    
- The Functional API can handle models with multiple inputs and outputs.
    
- Another powerful feature of the Functional API is shared layers, which are helpful when you want to apply the same transformation to multiple inputs.
    
- Creating custom layers in Keras allows you to tailor your models to specific needs, implement novel research ideas, and optimize performance for unique tasks. 
    
- By practicing and experimenting with custom layers, you’ll better understand how neural networks work and enhance your innovation ability. 
    
- TensorFlow 2.x is a powerful and flexible platform for machine learning with features such as eager execution, high-level APIs, and a rich ecosystem of tools. 
    
- Understanding these features and capabilities will help you build and deploy machine learning models more effectively, whether working on research, prototyping, or production applications.
